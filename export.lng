We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as [it were] beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, Be reconciled to God. Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that *we* might become God''s righteousness in him. (2 Cor 5:18-21)'

#Note to translators: You should NOT translate the various operators AND, OR, NOT, XOR, TR, etc, neither for the buttons nor in the corresponding hints. Where they appear, leave them as they are.

You can translate of course the hints and the examples, but the actual operators in the examples should be left as they are (AND, OR, etc)
cmdOpAND.Caption='And'
cmdOpAND.Hint='Use the "AND" operator if you want both expressions/words on the right and left to match.'#13#13'Example:'#13'  Jesus AND Christ '#13'will match those verses that contain both words '#13'"Jesus" and "Christ" '#13#13'TIP: You can use the "&" character instead of the word "AND". '
cmdOpOR.Caption='Or'
#Note to translators: Do not use the actual pipe character (|) in the Hint because it is a special character and if used in the Hint it will break it.
cmdOpOR.Hint='Use the "OR" operator if you want at least one of the expressions/words on the right and left to match.'#13#13'Example:'#13'  Jesus OR Christ '#13'will match those verses that contain either of the words '#13'"Jesus" or "Christ" '#13#13'TIP: You can use the [pipe] ([vertical bar]) character instead of the word "OR". '
cmdOpNot.Caption='Not'
cmdOpNot.Hint='Use the "NOT" operator if you want to negate the expression/word following it.'#13#13'Example:'#13'  NOT Jesus'#13'will match those verses that do NOT contain the word "Jesus"'#13#13'TIP: You can use the "~" character instead of the word "NOT". '
cmdOpNear.Caption='NearV'
cmdOpNear.Hint='Use the "NEARv" operator if you want both expressions/words on the right and left to match in adjacent VERSES. By default, the number of consecutive verses being examined is 3 (you can set this on the options tab). If you put a number after the "NEARv" operator (for example "NEARv8"), then the number of consecutive verses being examined will match this number.'#13#13'Example 1:'#13'  Jesus NEARv Christ'#13'will match if both words "Jesus" and "Christ" are found within 3 consecutive verses.'#13#13'Example 2:'#13'  Jesus NEARv10 Christ'#13'will match if both words "Jesus" and "Christ" are found within 10 consecutive verses (the number after the "NEARv" operator defines the span of the consecutive verses being examined).'#13#13'TIP: You can use the "#" character instead of the word "NEARv" (and the "#8" instead of "NEARv8", for example). '
cmdOpNearW.Caption='NearW'
cmdOpNearW.Hint='Use the "NEARw" operator if you want both expressions/words on the right and left to match in adjacent WORDS. By default, the number of consecutive words being examined is 30 (you can set this on the options tab). If you put a number after the "NEARw" operator (for example "NEARw8"), then the number of consecutive words being examined will match this number.'#13#13'Example 1:'#13'  Jesus NEARw Christ'#13'will match if both words "Jesus" and "Christ" are found within 30 consecutive words.'#13#13'Example 2:'#13'  Jesus NEARw50 Christ'#13'will match if both words "Jesus" and "Christ" are found within 50 consecutive words (the number after the "NEARw" operator defines the span of the consecutive words being examined).'#13#13'TIP: You can use the "@" character instead of the word "NEARw" (and the "@8" instead of "NEARw8", for example). '
cmdOpXor.Caption='Xor'
cmdOpXor.Hint='Use the "XOR" operator if you want exactly one of the expressions/words on the right and left to match.'#13#13'Example:'#13'  Jesus XOR Christ'#13'will match those verses that contain the word "Jesus" but not the word "Christ", or those verses that contain the word "Christ" but not the word "Jesus".'#13#13'TIP: You can use the "^" character instead of the word "XOR".'
cmdOpTR.Caption='TR'
cmdOpTR.Hint='The "TR" operator is used when performing searches on Strong''s numbers. When using the "TR" operator, the left operant should be a Strong''s index (e.g. G729, H324) and the right operant can be any valid expression that is evaluated on the text segment that is used to translate the given Strong''s index. Actually, the "TR" means "TRANSLATED" and provides a way to search on the translated words representing this Strong''s number. This is very useful if you need to see how a word in the original texts is translated. '#13#13'For example, the Greek word "Κύριος" has been assigned the Strong''s index G2962. But in English, this word is translated with the following words: Lord, Sir, Master, etc. If you want to search for all instances of the G2962 where the translated word is "Master" you can enter:'#13'  G2962 > master'#13'or'#13'  G2962 TR master'#13#13'To find the verses where the G2962 is not translated as “lord” you can enter:'#13'  G2962 > ~ lord'#13'or'#13'  G2962 TR NOT lord'#13#13'To find the verses where the word “lord” exists in a verse but G2962 is not used for it''s translation you can enter:'#13'  ~G2962 > lord*'#13' or'#13'  NOT G2962 TR lord*'
cmdOpMorph.Hint='"m/" operator is used to search morphological data (grammar) for modules that have this information. Please, read here how the search of the grammatical elements occur, or else the results you get might be unexpected.'#13#13'Morphological data are coded with letters (e.g. V-AAI-3S, @ncmsa), each one denoting a grammatical part of the structure of the word (e.g. "v" is usually used for verb, "n" for noun etc). Remember that each module may use a different notation, which is usually explained in the information accompanying each module.'#13#13'The general form of the search pattern is "m/lemma@tag" (@ can be replaced with % for Aramaic words: when omitted, @ is assumed). The "lemma" may also be omitted (the "lemma" information is not present in all modules: if absent, lemma search tags are also ignored). The "*" and "?" operators can be used for "any number of chars" and "single char". Also, square brackets can be used for a character class (e.g. [mf] means either m or f for a specific character position). Morphological searches are basically string matching searches on the lemma and morphology tag. Searches on the morphology tags are case sensitive if this is defined in the module (irrespective of the "Ignore case" setting). The "m/" tag may also be used as the right operand of the TR operator in order to combine Strong''s numbers and morphology characteristics.'#13#13'Examples (Greek NT):'#13' - m/N-NSF finds all Nouns in Nominative Singular Feminine form'#13' - m/N-* finds all Nouns'#13' - m/V-???-3? finds all Verbs in 3rd person'#13' - m/V-A??-?S finds all Verbs in Aorist in Singular (any person)'#13' - m/γεννάω@* finds all verbs that stem from γεννάω (γεννάω is the root of the word)'#13' - m/γεννάω@?-???-3P finds all verbs that stem from γεννάω and appear in the 3rd plural'#13' - m/γ*@N* finds all words whose root starts from γ and are nouns'#13' - G1080 TR m/V-???3P finds all words(verbs) with G1080 Strong''s number that are verbs in the 3rd plural'#13' - G80 TR m/N-D?? finds all words(nouns) with G80 Strong''s number that are in Dative case.'#13#13' Examples (Hebrew OT, Westminster Morphology):'#13' - m/@v* finds all verbs of Hebrew origin'#13' - m/v??3*+Rq finds all 3rd person verbs, Qere readings only, Hebrew or Aramaic'#13' - m/%*+Nq finds all Aramaic lemmas with the Note q (different Ketiv/Qere relative to BHS).'#13' - m/n*s*+* finds all singular nouns'#13' - m/ברא@* finds all words forms stemming from ברא'#13' - m/ב*@[na]* finds any Hebrew noun or adjective starting with the letter ב'
#NOTICE: the space between the parenthesis is a non-breaking space (hex:a0, dec: 160). Do not translate, leave as is (copy it)
cmdOpPar.Caption='( )'
cmdOpPar.Hint='Use parenthesis "( ... )" to group sub-expressions and apply priorities to the operators. By default, all operators are evaluated left to right. By using parenthesis you can change that order.'#13#13'Example 1:'#13'  (Jesus AND Christ) OR (Peter AND Paul)'#13'will match those verses that contain either both words "Jesus" and "Christ", or both words "Peter" and "Paul".'#13#13'Example 2:'#13'  (Jesus NEAR5 Peter) AND NOT (Jesus NEAR10 John)'#13'will match those verses/passages where the word "Jesus" appears within 5 verses (maximum) away from the word "Peter", and at the same time the word "John" does not appear within the next/previous 10 verses along with the word "Jesus".'
#NOTICE: the space between the double quote is a non-breaking space (hex:a0, dec: 160). Do not translate, leave as is (copy it)

cmdOpPhrase.Hint='Use double quotes " ... " to enclose more than one word if you want them to be considered as a phrase.'#13#13'Example:'#13'  "Jesus Christ is Lord"'#13'will match those verses that contain this exact phrase. If you have omitted the double quotes, then (depending on the default operator AND or OR) the above phrase would be equivalent with "Jesus OR Christ OR is OR Lord" or "Jesus AND Christ AND is AND Lord"'#13#13'Please, notice that punctuation is not ignored.

\pard\widctlpar\sb105\sa60\sl300\slmult0\qc\cf2\fs20 Please read carefully and consider prayerfully\par\
\pard\widctlpar\sa120\sl300\slmult0\qc\cf3\fs16 (you need about \cf4 2 minutes\cf3  to read through it)\par\
\pard\widctlpar\sb105\sa120\sl300\slmult0\cf1\fs24 Introduction\par\
\cf3\fs18 Dear \b theWord \b0 user,\par\
This short notice \f1\lang1033 aims to provide some information in order to help you \b make an educated decision\b0  \f0\lang1032 concerning the possibility of making a monetary donation as a way to support and further promote the development of \b theWord\b0\f1\lang1033 .  \f0\lang1032 I hope that theWord has proved to be a helpful tool to assist you in the study of the Word of God.\par\
Please take the time to read through this notice as a minimum gesture of appreciation for\~this free software you use.\par\
\cf1\fs24 theWord is free for you, but actually quite costly\par\
\cf3\fs18 theWord consists of about 300,000 lines of code and is the result of about 13,000 hours of working time (this corresponds to about 6-7 years of labor). It is by the grace and provision of God that it has been possible to invest labor to make this program \cf2 high-quality and genuinely free\cf3 . \par\
The fact that theWord is \cf2 free for you\cf3  does not mean that there are no costs associated with the development and support of it. Indeed, the actual costs behind this program are very high, in terms of time and money. \par\
\cf1\fs24 Consider a monetary donation\par\
\cf3\fs18 I would like you to seriously consider the possibility of making a donation to further promote the development of theWord.\~ Every amount given is important and greatly appreciated.\~ Furthermore, a monetary donation enables theWord to be developed faster and more efficiently. It seems fair, even according to the Word of God, though not obligatory, to consider this appeal seriously. \par\
I understand that it is not easy to decide to make a donation, and the most common reason is not the cost but the hassle of doing so. I also understand that it is normal for people to be reluctant to give their personal data or make an online payment or donation. However, I would have you to realize that the effort of actually making a donation is very small for you, in comparison with the great time and effort that is invested in this software.\par\
Having said all the above, I want to repeat that this appeal is not intended to coerce you in any way to make a donation, but to make you better realize that what is given to you freely actually has an enormous hidden cost, which has been \lquote paid\rquote  mostly by a single individual. \b I would like you to decide based upon these facts\b0 . Unfortunately, the Internet is full of \lquote free\rquote  stuff that is either not genuinely \lquote free\rquote  in the end, or of such low quality that you would never pay to use it. On the contrary, \cf2 theWord is and will remain truly free!\cf3  \~\par\
\cf1\fs24 What will you get if you decide to donate\par\
\cf3\fs18 I would like you to know that whether you choose to donate or not, the software will work in exactly the same way. Furthermore, if you do indeed donate you will have no extra benefit regarding the program functionality itself.\par\
However, if you make a donation, in order to show you my appreciation for your extra trouble, I will send you by mail a CD or a USB flash drive with \b theWord \b0 (the USB flash drive contains \cf2 theWord toGo\cf3 , which will run on any PC by just inserting the flash drive into a USB port; there is absolutely no installation). These are only gifts, they are optional and depend on the amount of the donation. \par\
\cf0 Read more about \b theWord toGo \b0 flash drive here: {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.theword.net/togo }}{\fldrslt{http://www.theword.net/togo\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs18 .\par\
\cf1\fs24 Please, act on your decision\par\
\cf3\fs18 If you have decided to donate, please visit the official site at {\cf0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.theword.net/donate }}{\fldrslt{http://www.theword.net/donate\ul0\cf0}}}}\cf5\ul\f0\fs18  \cf3\ulnone to do so.\par\
\cf2\fs20 Thank you for your time\cf3\fs22 ,\par\

  Includes a single <b>Bible view</b> to read your Bible and a 
	list/tree on the left for navigating through the different books of the Bible. 
	You can switch between different translations by clicking on 
	the tabs/buttons at the top of the Bible view.
	<br>
	<b>Quick tip!</b>
	<br>
	<b>Views</b> are rectangular areas within the main window of <b>theWord</b>, 
	used for a particular function. There are five different view types, yet the 
	two most important views are the <font color=#3064F8><b>Bible view</b></font> and 
	the <font color=#EB6307><b>Book view.</b></font><br>
	The captions of the views (<font color=red>red square</font>) are <u>colored according to their function.</u>
	Notice that:
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top><img src="caption-bible-view"></td>
		<td width=100%%><font color=#3064F8><b>Bible views</b></font> (using <font color=#3064F8><b>blue</b></font> 
			captions) are used to display <u>Bible text.</u> Clicking on the tabs/buttons on the top allows you 
			to switch between different Bible translations.

	<br>
  Includes a <font color=#3064F8><b>Bible view</b></font> to read your Bible and a 
  <font color=#EB6307><b>Book view</b></font>
  where you can read all reference material. The Book view is <b>linked</b> with the
  Bible view so all commentaries automatically show the appropriate comment as
  you read through your Bible. Clicking on a word in the 
  <font color=#3064F8><b>Bible view</b></font> will also
  cause all dictionaries in the <font color=#EB6307><b>Book view</b></font> to show 
  the definition of this word (if present).
  <br>
  The <font color=#3064F8><b>Bible view</b></font> has a few more options enabled, like
  passage headings and footnotes. 
  On the right column there are also the two Search views: 
  <ul>
  	<li>the one with the <font color=green><b>green</b></font> caption is the 
  		<font color=green><b>Bible search view</b></font>, used to search the Bible.
  	<li>the one with the <font color=purple><b>purple</b></font> caption is the 
  		<font color=purple><b>Book search view</b></font>, used to search reference material.
  </ul>
  Click on the <b>X</b> button on the top-right of a view to close it. 
  Use the <b>Window</b> menu to reopen views.

	<br>
  Includes a <font color=#3064F8><b>Bible view</b></font> to read your Bible and 
  two  <font color=#EB6307><b>Book views</b></font> at the bottom.
  The left <font color=#EB6307><b>Book view</b></font> contains
  all available non-Bible modules whereas the right one contains only commentaries.
  On the left column there is also the <font color=#A39A01><b>Bible tree</b></font>. 
  <hr>
  <b>Quick Tip:</b><br>
  <table><tr>
  	<td valign=top><img src="books"></td>
  	<td width=100%%>Notice the icon with the <b>green books</b>  on the leftmost
  		area of each Book view (<font color=red>red square</font> on the screenshot). 
  		Clicking on it allows you to choose what modules you want
  		to have available on the current <font color=#EB6307><b>Book view</b></font>.
  		</td> 
  	</tr>
  </table>
  You can open as many <font color=#EB6307><b>Book views</b></font> as you like 
  and choose the type of modules you want
  each one to display. So, you can have one <font color=#EB6307>Book view</font> with all 
  	your <font color=maroon>dictionaries</font>,
  one with all your <font color=blue>commentaries</font> and one with your 
  <font color=green>graphics</font>. You can even choose
  specific modules to put there and even group them together in categories from the 
  <b>Define module sets...</b> dialog (accessible from the green books icon).
  <hr>
  Remember that you can re-arrange all views within theWord by clicking on their caption
  with the mouse and dragging to a different position. Try also the <b>Dock to</b> menu,
  accessible from the system button of each view (<img src="system-button">, 
  <img src="system-button-2">, etc.)
